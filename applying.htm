            <strong>General Application Procedure</strong>
  			<p>The NYU Biology Department awards about 12 doctoral fellowships each year to U.S. and Foreign Applicants. The procedure at NYU Biology is for prospective applicants to submit a full application to the biology department. The details can be accessed </strong><a href="http://biology.as.nyu.edu/page/graduate.programs">here</a>. Applicants are assessed by a committee comprised of a cross-section of research expertise in the department.  <u>Principle Investigators do not directly recruit students</u> in their labs but one important criteria is that the student's interests match with at least a few labs in the department. Admitted students carry out three rotations in the first year to come to a mutual agreement with a PI or co-PI mentors in joining a lab to complete their doctoral thesis.  </p>
  			
            <strong>Opportunities in my Lab</strong> 
  			<p>I am currently accepting graduate PhD rotators who are interested in a potential thesis that focuses on plant regeneration and development. We are currently funded to carry out our regeneration work. I am also funded for algae work and I am also taking rotators on that project.</p>
  			
            <strong>Research Atmosphere</strong> 
  			<p>We are a diverse department focused on basic science. My lab is housed in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, a block away from Washington Square in the neighborhood of Greenwich Village. We have a great experimental system in which students can address basic questions in plant developmental biology while incorporating new techniques in our field, such as cell-specific expression profiling and single-cell RNA-seq. More broadly, one of the strengths of the center is the opportunity to develop computational and high throughput analysis skills. We offer a range of courses that cater to students with little or no quantitative background or those who come with a strong mathematical or computational background. This means that there is a deep set of peer and PI resources around you that can help you, for example, debug your first R script or develop novel computational approaches in a range of programming languages. The atmosphere among PIs and graduate students is highly collegial and the informal peer-to-peer facet of our training is a great strength.</strong></p>
  			
            <strong>Graduate Life</strong> 
  			<p>If you are admitted to the program, you get full tuition remission and a stipend  to cover all your living expenses.  Stipends are typically paid by a mixture of university and PI funds throughout a PhD student&rsquo;s tenure in the department. Therefore, graduate students in the basic sciences typically finish their degrees with no debt from their education. At NYU, the university provides subsidized housing for the first year at nearby Stuyvesant Town apartments. After that, graduate students usually find roommates and rent an apartment within reasonable commuting distance. In addition to the great research atmosphere at NYU biology,  NYC is a diverse, international city with great food, music, and arts of all kinds. We are in Greenwich Village. The city is safe and the living conditions that students find are comfortable.</strong></p>
